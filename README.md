# Google Cloud Container Builder Local Builder

**Local Builder** runs [Google Cloud Container Builder] builds locally,
allowing easier debugging, execution of builds on your own hardware,
and integration into local build and test workflows.

----

## Prerequisites
- gcloud
- docker
- go (if you build the tool yourself)

If the build needs to access a private GCR registry, install and configure the
[Docker credential helper for GCR users](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/docker-credential-gcr).

The local builder uses gcloud information to set up a spoofed metadata server,
so you have to set the project:
```
gcloud config set project my-project
```

## Install using gcloud

```
gcloud components install container-builder-local
```
After successful installation, you will have ``container-builder-local`` setup on your PATH (as part of the google-cloud-sdk binaries), so you will be able to run it with:

```
$ container-builder-local 
2017/08/23 10:16:03 Specify a source
Usage: container-builder-local --config=cloudbuild.yaml [--substitutions=_FOO=bar] [--[no]dryrun] [--[no]push] source
````

## Download the latest binaries

The latest binaries are available in a GCS bucket.

[Download](https://storage.googleapis.com/container-builder-local/container-builder-local_latest.tar.gz) the latest binaries from GCS.

To run a build:

```
./container-builder-local_{linux,darwin}_{386,amd64}-v<latest_tag> --dryrun=false --config=path/to/cloudbuild.yaml path/to/code
```

## Developing Local Builder

To build and develop Local Builder, you need a working [Go environment].

Run the following commands to install the tool:

```
go get github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/container-builder-local
go install github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/container-builder-local
```

To run a build:

```
./bin/container-builder-local --dryrun=false --config=path/to/cloudbuild.yaml path/to/code
```

To run the tests (without the vendored libraries):
```
go test $(go list github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/container-builder-local/... | grep -v vendor)
```

## Limitations

- Only one build can be run at a time on a given host.
- The tool doesn't work on Windows yet, PR welcome.
